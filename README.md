# Arduino-Two-Motors

## The project was created using an Arduino to control 2 DC motors with the help of H bridge l298n.
*important note: in this circuit the H bridge l293d was used due to absence of l298n from components list on Tinkercad.com which is used to draw the circuit*
Two pictures of the Circuit diagram was provided:
1-Circuit.png
Shows how the two Dc motors are connected with the Arduino.
2-Simulation.png
Shows the circuit when the simulation begins and the Dc motors starts moving.

The code was provided in the .ino file and a discription of each step was illustrated inside it.
